%NN Type
This paper introduces a simple neural network - Word Prediction Neural Networks (\sys) . 
{\sys} is a supervised classification machine learning algorithm.
%Purpose
It is used to predict the next word  in a sentence. 
%Input and Output
\sys takes three words as the input which is used to predict  the next word in the sentence.
\sys has two hidden layers and one output layer. 
The first hidden layer represents the features of different input words.
The second hidden layer is a layer that connects with all neural in the first layer.
The output layer is a vector to index the predicted word.
